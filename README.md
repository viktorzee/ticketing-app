**Installing**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Install the dependencies for each of the client and server code by running the following command:

`npm install`

**Running the App**

For running the client and server code, 


**Client**

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
    Start the client by running the following command:
